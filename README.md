# GDSC Interview Round 2

## About
My submission for Google Developer Student Clubs Interview Round 2. This repository contains solutions for different technical domains, with each task implemented in separate branches.

## Domains & Tasks

I'm planning to work on tasks from these domains:
- **Web Development** 
- **Mobile Development**
- **Machine Learning**
- **DevOps**
- **Open Source**

Each domain will have its own branch with specific implementations.

## Branch Structure

- `main` - Repository setup and documentation
- `web-dev` - Web development tasks
- `mobile-dev` - Mobile app development
- `ml-tasks` - Machine learning projects
- `devops-tasks` - DevOps implementations
- `opensource` - Open source contributions

## Tech Stack

Will be updated as I work on different tasks. Currently using:
- Git & GitHub for version control
- VS Code as development environment

## Project Structure
```
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── src/          # Source code
├── assets/       # Images and resources
└── docs/         # Documentation
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parvbansal21/GDSC-Interview-Round.git

```

2. Switch to a specific task branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

## Development Notes

- Each task is developed in its own branch
